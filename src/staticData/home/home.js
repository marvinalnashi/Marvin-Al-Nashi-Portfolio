It offers a highly configurable interface that adapts to various professional contexts, working styles, and user preferences. Users can adjust system behaviours, layouts, themes, sound schemes, launchers, and application bundles to suit specific tasks or personal preferences. Rather than being constrained to predefined roles, users can configure their environment for development, design, media production, research, or general use." },

Users can install and manage different editions of the system, each with its own combination of user interface components, software packages, services, and behaviours. These editions can be used independently or combined into a hybrid setup. Switching between configurations does not affect the underlying system, allowing users to move seamlessly between roles or tasks while maintaining a consistent experience." },

                        { type: "paragraph", text: "The project begins with CHAOS DE, a desktop environment that can be installed on top of any Linux distribution. It offers a highly configurable interface that adapts to various professional contexts, working styles, and user preferences. Users can adjust system behaviours, layouts, themes, sound schemes, launchers, and application bundles to suit specific tasks or personal preferences. Rather than being constrained to predefined roles, users can configure their environment for development, design, media production, research, or general use." },
                        { type: "paragraph", text: "A core feature of CHAOS is its ability to support multiple configurations within a single installation. Users can install and manage different editions of the system, each with its own combination of user interface components, software packages, services, and behaviours. These editions can be used independently or combined into a hybrid setup. Switching between configurations does not affect the underlying system, allowing users to move seamlessly between roles or tasks while maintaining a consistent experience." },
                        { type: "paragraph", text: "The system is built on a component-based architecture that separates the core functionality from the user interface and feature layers. This structure makes it possible to update or swap out parts of the system without compromising stability. It also allows users to install custom modules to extend and fine-tune the environment according to their own needs without modifying the base system." },
                        { type: "paragraph", text: "CHAOS is designed to be accessible, customisable, and efficient. It prioritises usability and performance while providing detailed control options for both casual and advanced users. The system scales well across a variety of hardware platforms and usage scenarios, from personal devices to workstations in enterprises." },
                        { type: "paragraph", text: "In the longer term, CHAOS will evolve into a complete Linux distribution. This includes the development of a dedicated window manager and an optimised kernel, along with other core components. These elements will follow the same design principles: modularity, adaptability, and consistency across the system." },
